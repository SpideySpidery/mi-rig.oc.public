    <li><strong>Alias</strong>: SpideySpidery  </li>
    <li><strong>Affiliation</strong>: Independent operative; aligns with others when necessary.  </li>
    <li><strong>Role</strong>: Hero, anti-hero, leader, lone wolf, or one-man army, depending on the storyline.  </li>
    <li><strong>Origin</strong>: The details of Liam Hill’s origin vary across different stories, but a consistent event ties them all together: a life-altering incident where a sharp object pierces his originally blue (cyan) eye, transforming it into the <strong>Blood Eye</strong>. This singular event shapes his identity and destiny, marking him as someone chosen—or cursed—for extraordinary paths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="2-forms-and-abilities"><strong>2. Forms and Abilities</strong></h4>
    <h3 id="first-form-g-e-n-e-r-a-l"><strong>First Form (G E N E R A L)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>An Average Guy</strong>: Despite his extraordinary abilities, Liam begins as an unassuming individual blending into the world.  </li>
    <li><strong>Parkour Legend</strong>: With unmatched agility, Liam is a master of parkour, capable of scaling buildings, jumping across large gaps, and dodging obstacles with ease. His reflexes are lightning-fast, allowing him to react almost instantaneously to danger or changing environments.  </li>
    <li><strong>Sword Master</strong>: </li>
    <li><strong>Trained in Kalaripayattu</strong>: Kalaripayattu is an ancient Indian martial art that emphasizes physical fitness, mental discipline, and a comprehensive approach to combat. It blends strikes, kicks, sweeps, and blocks with the use of weapons like swords and staffs. A highly skilled swordsman, Liam combines agility and precision in battle. His swordsmanship is not just about strength, but finesse, focusing on the perfect strike, defense, and counterattack. Liam’s training in Kalaripayattu enhances his martial combat skills, giving him an intuitive understanding of body movement and flow during battle. He can execute powerful, graceful moves and fluid transitions from defense to attack, using his body like a weapon. This mastery also provides him with a deep sense of mental discipline, focusing his energy during intense situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="second-form-d-e-m-o-n"><strong>Second Form (D E M O N)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Retains All Powers from First Form</strong>: All the abilities from the first form remain intact.  </li>
    <li><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>: Liam’s strength reaches superhuman levels, allowing him to overpower much stronger foes and break through barriers that would otherwise be unbreakable.  </li>
    <li><strong>Power Dash</strong>: A high-speed burst of movement that allows Liam to close gaps quickly, evade attacks, or perform rapid offensive maneuvers.  </li>
    <li><strong>Elemental Control</strong>:  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fire</strong>: Liam can summon and manipulate fire at will, shooting flames from his hands and shaping them into destructive forms.  </li>
    <li><strong>Ice</strong>: He can generate ice spikes and freeze objects or enemies, using ice to control the battlefield.  </li>
    <li><strong>Electricity</strong>: Liam can control and direct lightning, manipulating thunderstorms, and harnessing electricity for various purposes, including shock attacks or powering devices. He can even shoot out lightning from his BARE Hands.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fire &amp; Ice Immunity</strong>: Liam is impervious to damage from fire, ice, or water-based attacks, rendering most elemental attacks ineffective against him.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4 id="3-weaknesses"><strong>3. Weaknesses</strong></h4>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Energy Depletion</strong>: His ability to control fire, ice, and electricity requires immense energy. If he overuses these elemental powers without proper rest, he risks exhausting himself and becoming weaker or even incapacitated.  </li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Vulnerability</strong>: Liam&#39;s ego can sometimes be his downfall. If his pride or confidence is challenged too severely, it may cloud his judgment, leading him to make rash decisions or underestimate his enemies.  </li>
    <li><strong>Tragic Past - Mental Attacks</strong>: Liam&#39;s past is filled with loss and betrayal, events that have left deep emotional scars. His tragic history can be exploited through mental or emotional attacks, weakening his resolve or clouding his judgment. Psychological manipulation can cause him to relive painful memories, momentarily crippling him. This makes him vulnerable to enemies who can exploit his emotional state, especially when he is reminded of his past trauma.  </li>
    <li><strong>Physical Limitation</strong>: While he has superhuman strength, his human body still has limits. If faced with prolonged or excessive strain, such as enduring too much damage or overexerting his powers, he can experience physical fatigue or injury.</li>
    </ul>
